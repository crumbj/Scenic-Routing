# Abstract
Learning about computer networking often requires access to college courses, which are not accessible to everyone who is interested in the topic. Scenic Routing is an open source resource that walks computer science students through the process of creating their own computer networking projects. The project is divided into three components:
  1) Creating a virtual network of computers that can be scaled up using Docker, Kubernetes, and VrNetLab’s containerized OpenWRT routers. 
  2) Designing and implementing a routing algorithm combining the Graph Coloring algorithm, Kruskal’s Algorithm, and Breadth First Search and a routing protocol 
  3) Creating a visualization of the network running the protocol to show the path of the packets of data being routed using a CentOS Virtual Machine, Unity,     Elasticsearch, and Zeek. 
 
Scenic Routing aims to provide students with resources to create virtual networks, implement routing protocols, and visualize network traffic by providing tutorials and documentation for each component. This way, learning about computer networking can be accessible to anyone.
